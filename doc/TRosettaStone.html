<p><i><font size=-2>The Rosetta Stone was the key that unlocked the mysteries
of Egyptian hieroglyphics. It contains an inscription praising King Ptolemy
V, which is repeated three times - once in hieroglyphic, once in demotic,
and once in Greek. By translating the Greek, comparisons could be made
with the demotic and hieroglyphic versions, providing an invaluable lexicon
with which to translate other hieroglyphic works. The efforts that went
into making the document you are now reading could be likened to a form
of digital arch&aelig;ology, and hopefully this document will provide sufficient
information for others to decipher and create their own "TR-hieroglyphic"
works.</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document contains detailed descriptions of the
Tomb Raider II data file formats ({Level-name}.TR2 and TOMBPC.DAT). It
is assumed that the reader has knowledge and experience programming in
C or C++, and has at least a passing familiarity with graphics programming.
This document is self-contained; all hyperlinks refer only to itself. All
information in this document was derived independently, without the aid
or assistance of anyone at Core Design or Eidos. As such, the information
in this document may contain errors or omissions, and all structure and
variable names were deduced from the interpretation of the data (and therefore
could be misleading or completely wrong). All the information in this document
was tested and is therefore plausible, but could also be a misinterpretation.
All information herein is provided as is - you get what you pay for, and
this one's free. This was a spare-time project that set out to document
the Tomb Raider 2 file format; along the way, additional information about
Tomb Raider 1 / Gold (.PHD, .TUB) and Tomb Raider 3 (.TR2) files became
available, and that information is provided in context. Where applicable,
Tomb Raider I, Tomb Raider Unfinished Business, and Tomb Raider Gold are
all referred to as TR1, and if the information specific to TR1 is interspersed
with TR2 information, the <font color="#FF0000">TR1 information is highlighted
in RED</font>. Likewise, Tomb Raider III is referred to as TR3, and <font color="#008000">information
specific to TR3 is highlighted in GREEN</font>.&nbsp; In the few places
where there is such information, <font color="#000080">information specific
to TR2 ONLY is highlighted in BLUE</font>.&nbsp; Everything else is assumed
to pertain to TR2 only, or to all three games. [Late note: as this document
was being prepared for release, the Tomb Raider: Last Revelation demo was
released.&nbsp; .TR4 files will be hopefully be addressed in a future revision
of this document.]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of Core/Eidos' position on Tomb Raider level
editing tools, it is suggested that any tools that you develop be released
in source code form, anonymously, using Usenet newsgroups.&nbsp; Anonymity
can protect you from legal action, wide distribution via Usenet prevents
Core/Eidos from attempting to recall or control the distribution of your
software, and distributing source code both allows multi-platform development
(e.g. let others port it to the Mac or Linux for you) and encourages others
to write utilities, since they can learn and benefit from your source code.&nbsp;
Also, Linux has taught us that 40,000 people debugging a single application
makes for a clean final product ;-)

Modification and/or distribution of any part of a Tomb Raider data file

<p><a NAME="Fundamentals"></a><b><u><font size=+1>I. The Fundamentals</font></u></b></center>

<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Overview"></a><b>Overview:</b> Tomb Raider II
is driven by two sets of files. The script file, TOMBPC.DAT, contains all
the text strings describing the various elements in the game (e.g. the
game engine knows about "Key 1"; it looks in TOMBPC.DAT to determine the
name to be displayed in Lara's inventory, such as "Rusty Key" or "Taste
rostige" or "Cl&eacute; Rouill&eacute;e"), the level and cut-scene filenames
(e.g. WALL.TR2, CUT3.TR2), the order in which they are to be played, and
various per-level and per-game configuration options (e.g. what weapons
and objects Lara starts the level with, whether or not the "cheat" codes
work, etc.). The level files, {level-name}.TR2, contain everything about
the level, including the geographical geometry, the geometry (meshes) of
all animate and inanimate objects in the level, all the textures and colour
data, all animation data, index information (and, in TR1, the actual sound
sample data) for all sounds, accessibility maps - everything necessary
to run the game. For whatever reason, Core has included everything in one
file instead of breaking it up into logical groupings; this means that
every level contains all the meshes, textures, sound information, and animation
data for Lara and all of her weapons. There are a fair number of other
redundancies, too.

<p><a NAME="Data_Types"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of further discussion,
the following are assumed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bit8</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies an 8-bit signed integer (range -128..127)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bitu8</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies an 8-bit unsigned integer (range 0..255)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bit16</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies a 16-bit signed integer (range -32768..32767)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bitu16</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; specifies a 16-bit unsigned integer (range 0..65535)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bit32</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifies a 32-bit signed integer (range -2147483648..2147483647)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>bitu32</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; specifies a 32-bit unsigned integer (range 0..4294967295)
    
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All multi-byte integers (bit{u}16, bit{u}32) are
stored in little-endian (Intel-x86, etc.) format, with the least significant
byte stored first and the most significant byte stored last. When using
this data in platforms with big-endian (PowerPC, etc.) number format, be
sure to reverse the order of bytes.
<p>Data alignment is something one has to be careful about. When some entity
gets an address that is a multiple of n, it is said to be n-byte aligned.
The reason it is important here is that some systems prefer multibyte alignment
for multibyte quantities, and compilers for such systems may pad the data
to get the "correct" alignments, thus making the in-memory structures out
of sync with their file counterparts. However, a compiler may be commanded
to use a lower level of alignment, one that will not cause padding. And
for TR's data structures, 2-byte alignment should be successful in nearly
all cases, with exceptions noted below.

<p>To set single-byte alignment in <u>Microsoft Visual C++</u>, use the following compiler directive:
<pre>#pragma pack(push, tr2, 1)</pre>
To return to the project's default alignment, use the following directive:
<pre>#pragma pack(pop, tr2)</pre>

<p>To achieve 2-byte alignment in <u>Metrowerks CodeWarrior</u>, widely used in
the MacOS, use this compiler directive:
<pre>#pragma options align=mac68k</pre>
To return to the project's default alignment, use this directive:
<pre>#pragma options align=reset</pre>
Similar options exist for other compilers.

<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Coordinates"></a><b>Coordinates:</b> The world
coordinate system is oriented with the X-Z plane horizontal and Y vertical,
with -Y being "up" (e.g. decreasing Y values indicate increasing altitude).
The world coordinate system is specified using bit32 values; however, the
geography is limited to the +X/+Z quadrant for reasons that are explained
below. Mesh coordinates are relative and are specified using <a href="#Data_Types">bit16</a>s.&nbsp;
There are some additional coordinate values used, such as "the number of
1024-unit blocks between points A and B";&nbsp; these are simply scaled
versions of more conventional coordinates.
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Colours"></a><b>Colours:</b> All colours in TR2
are specified either explicitly (using either the <a href="#struct.tr2_colour">tr2_colour</a>
structure, described below, or the 16-bit ARGB structure) or implicitly,
by indexing one of the palettes.&nbsp; If, for some reason, 16-bit textures
are turned off, all colours and textures use an 8-bit palette that is stored
in the .TR2 file.&nbsp; This palette consists of a 256-element array of
<a href="#struct.tr2_colour">tr2_colour</a>
structures, each designating some colour;&nbsp; textures and other elements
that need to reference a colour specify an index (0..255) into the Palette[]
array.&nbsp; There is also a 16-bit palette, which is used for identifying
colours of solid polygons.&nbsp; The 16-bit palette contains up to 256
four-byte entries;&nbsp; the first three bytes are a <a href="#struct.tr2_colour">tr2_colour</a>,
while the last byte is ignored (set to 0).
<br>The 16-bit textile array, which contains <a href="#struct.tr2_textile16">tr2_textile16</a>
structures, specifies colours using 16-bit ARGB, where the highest bit
(0x8000) is a crude alpha channel (really just simple transparency - 0
::= transparent, 1 ::= opaque).&nbsp; The next 5 bits (0x7c00) specify
the red channel, the next 5 bits (0x03e0) specify the green channel, and
the last 5 bits (0x001f) specify the blue channel, each on a scale from
0..31.
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Objects"></a><b>Objects:</b> There are two basic
types of objects in TR2 - meshes and sprites. <b>Meshes</b> are collections
of textured or coloured polygons that are assembled to form a three-dimensional
object (such as a tree, a tiger, or Lara herself). The "rooms" themselves
are also composed of meshes. Mesh objects may contain more than one mesh;
though these meshes are moved relative to each other, each mesh is rigid.
<b>Sprites</b>
are two-dimensional images that are inserted into three-dimensional space,
such as the "secret" dragons, ammunition, medi-packs, etc. There are also
animated sprite sequences, such as the fire at the end of "The Great Wall."
Core had presumably used this method to reduce CPU utilization on the PlayStation
and/or the earlier PCs. Sprites become less and less abundant; TR2 has
very few scenery sprites, and TR3's pickups are models instead of sprites.
Objects are referenced in one of two ways - as an offset into an array
(e.g. Moveables[i]) or using an identifying tag (ObjectID). In the latter
case, the related array (Items[], Moveables[], etc.) is searched until
a matching ObjectID is found.
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Animations"></a><b>Animations:</b> There are three
basic types of animations in TR2, two corresponding directly with meshes
and sprites, and a third type, animated textures. Sprite animation (sprite
sequences) consists simply of a series of sprites that are to be displayed
one after another, e.g. grenade explosions. Mesh animations are much more
complex, done by what is essentially a skeletal-modeling scheme. These
involve some arrays (Frames[] and MeshTree[]) of offsets and rotations
for each element of a composite mesh. Frames are then grouped into an array
(Animations[]) that describes discrete "movements," e.g. Lara taking a
step or a tiger striking with its paw. The animations are "sewn together"
by a state change array and an animation dispatch array, which, together
with state information about the character, ensure that the animation is
fluid (e.g. if Lara is running and the player releases the RUN key, she
will stop; depending upon which of her feet was down at the time, either
her left or right foot will strike the floor as part of the "stop" animation.
The correct animation (left foot stop vs. right foot stop) is selected
using these structures and the state information). Animated textures are
simply a list of textures that are cycled through in an endless loop; they
are normally used as geographic elements of the levels (e.g. water surface,
bubbling lava, Atlantean plasma walls).
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Lighting"></a><b>Lighting:</b> There are two main
types of lighting in Tomb Raider, constant and vertex. Constant lighting
means that all parts of an object have the same illumination, while in
vertex lighting, each polygon vertex has its own light value, and the illumination
of the polygon interiors is interpolated from the vertex values. Furthermore,
lighting can be either internal or external. Internal lighting is specified
in an object's data, external lighting is calculated using the room's light
sources (ambient light, point light sources, flares, gunshots). Light intensities
are described with a single value in TR1 and a pair of values in TR2 and
TR3; the paired values are almost always equal, and the pairing may reflect
some feature that was only imperfectly implemented, such as off/on or minimum/maximum
values. In TR1 and TR2, the light values go from 0 (maximum light) to 8192
(minimum light), while in TR3, the light values go from 0 (minimum light)
to 32767 (maximum light).
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_BasicDataStructures"></a><b>Basic Data Structures:</b>
Much of the .TR2 file is comprised of structures based on a few fundamental
data structures, described below.
<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="struct_tr2_colour"></a><b>Colour structure</b> - this is how most
colours are specified.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef struct {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // 3 bytes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#Data.Types">bitu8</a> Red;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Red component (0 ::= darkest, 255 ::= brightest)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#Data.Types">bitu8</a> Green;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Green component (0 ::= darkest, 255 ::= brightest)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="#Data.Types">bitu8</a> Blue;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Blue component (0 ::= darkest, 255 ::= brightest)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <b>tr2_colour</b>;
<br>(Some compilers, like CodeWarrior, will pad this structure to make 4
bytes; one must either read and write 3 bytes explicitly, or else use a
simple array of bytes instead of this structure.)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as mentioned earlier, the 16-bit palette uses a similar structure:

</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef struct { // 4 bytes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Data_Types">bitu8</a> Red;

<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Textures"></a><b>Textures:</b> All mesh surfaces
are either <b>coloured</b> or <b>textured</b>.&nbsp; Coloured surfaces
are "painted" with a single colour that is either specified explicitly
or using an index into the palette.&nbsp; Textured surfaces map textures
(bitmapped images) from the texture tiles (textiles) to each point on the
mesh surface.&nbsp; This is done using conventional UV mapping, which is
specified in "Object Textures" below; each object texture specifies a mapping
from a set of vertices to locations in the textile, and these texture vertices
are associated with position vertices specified here.
<p><a NAME="Fundamentals_Sounds"></a>
<p>
<hr>
<p><b>Sounds:</b> There are several sorts of sounds, which can be classified
as either continuous or triggered. Continuous sounds are level-background
sounds (such as the blowing wind in "The Great Wall") and sound sources
(such as waterfalls; these are in SoundSources[]). Triggered sounds are
sounds played when some event happens, such as at certain animation frames
(footsteps and other Lara sounds), when doors open and close, and when
weapons are fired. Sounds are stored in two places: the game-data files
and the CD audio tracks (the latter are separate soundfiles in the MacOS
version). The latter kind of sound is referred to straightforwardly, by
index, while the former kind of sound is referred to using a three-layer
indexing scheme, to provide a maximum amount of abstraction. An internal
sound index references SoundMap[], which points to a SoundDetails[] record,
which in turn points to a SampleIndices[] entry, which in turn points to
a sound sample. SoundDetails[] contains such features as sound intensity,
how many sound samples to choose from, among others. The sound samples
themselves are in Microsoft WAVE format, and they are embedded either in
the data files (TR1, some later TR demos) or in a separate file (MAIN.SFX)
in TR2 and TR3.

<p><a NAME="RoomGeometry_Overview"></a><b>Overview: </b>A <b>room</b> in
TR2 is simply a rectangular three-dimensional area. A room may be "indoors"
or "outdoors," may or may not be enclosed, may be accessible or inaccessible
to Lara, may or may not contain doors or objects. All rooms have "portals,"
called "doors" in some documentation, which are pathways to adjacent rooms.
There are two kinds of portals, visibility portals and collisional portals.
Visibility portals are for determining how much of a room (if any) is visible
from another room, while collisional portals are for enabling an object
to travel from one room to another. The visibility portals are most likely
for doing "portal rendering", which is a visibility-calculation scheme
that goes as follows: The viewpoint is a member of some room, which is
then listed as visible from it. This room's portals are checked for visibility
from that viewpoint, and visible portals have their opposite-side rooms
marked as visible. These rooms are then checked for portals that are visible
from the viewpoint through the viewpoint's room's portals, and visible
ones have their opposite-side rooms marked as visible. This operation is
repeated, with viewing through intermediate portals, until all visible
portals have been found. The result is a tree of rooms, starting from the
viewpoint's room; only those rooms and their contents need be rendered.
It is clear that both visibility and collision calculations require that
objects have room memberships given for them, and indeed we shall find
that most map objects have room memberships.
<p>Rooms may overlap; as we shall see, this is involved in how horizontal
collisional portals are implemented. However, different rooms may overlap
without either being directly accessible from the other; there are several
inadvertent examples of such "5D space" in the Tomb Raider series.  The
only possibly deliberate example I know of is the flying saucer in "Area
51" in TR3, whose interior is bigger than its exterior.
<p>A room can have an "alternate room" specified for it; that means that
that room can be replaced by that alternate as the game is running. This
trick is used to produce such tricks as empty rooms vs. rooms full of water,
scenery rearrangements (for example, the dynamited house in "Bartoli's
Hideout" in TR2), and so forth. An empty room is first created, and then
a full room is created at its location from a copy of it. The empty room
then has that full room set as its alternate, and when that room is made
to alternate, one sees a full room rather than an empty one.
<p>The rooms are stored sequentially in an array, and "Room Numbers" are
simply indices into this array (e.g. "Room Number 5" is simply Rooms[5];
the first room is Rooms[0]).
<p>Rooms are divided into <b>Sectors</b>, which are 1024x1024 unit squares
that form a grid on the X-Z plane.&nbsp; Sectors are the defining area
for floor/ceiling height and various actions (e.g. a tiger appears and
attacks when Lara steps on a given square);&nbsp; the various attributes
of each sector are stored in the Sector Data (described in this section)
and the <a href="#FloorData">FloorData</a>.&nbsp; As an aside, Sectors
correspond to the "squares," easily visible in all of the Tomb Raider games,
that experienced players count when gauging jumps;&nbsp; they also account
for some of the game's less-appealing graphic artifacts. Careful tiling
and texture construction can make these "squares" almost invisible.
<p>Rooms have two kinds of surfaces, rendered and collisional, much like
the two kinds of portals. The former are what is seen, while the latter
control how objects interact with the world geometry. Furthermore, these
two types are specified separately in the room data.
<p>Rooms are defined with a complex structure, which is described below
"inside-out," meaning that the smaller component structures are described
first, followed by the larger structures that are built using the smaller
structures.

how. Relative steps of 1 (-256) can be walked up; steps of 2..7 (-512..-1792)

<p><a NAME="FloorData"></a><b><u><font size=+1>III. FloorData</font></u></b></center>

<p>The <b>FloorData</b> defines special sector attributes such as floor
and ceiling slopes, collisional portals to other rooms, climbability of
walls, and all the various types of triggering. It is referenced by the
sectors as an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, e.g. the current sector
is calculated as (((CurrentX - tr2_room_info.x) / 1024) * tr2_room.NumZsectors)
+ ((CurrentZ - tr2_room_info.z) / 1024), which is then used as an offset
into tr2_room:: SectorList[]; tr2_room_sector::FDindex is an offset into
the FloorData[] array.
<p>The FloorData consists of opcodes and operands.&nbsp; Opcodes are 16
bits, as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Function</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bits 0..7 (0x00FF)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>SubFunction</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bits 8..14 (0x7F00)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>EndData</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bit 15 (0x8000)
<br>If <i>EndData</i> is set, there are no more opcodes (after the current
one) in this section of FloorData;&nbsp; otherwise, the next opcode in
FloorData should be interpreted after the current one.
<p>Some functions reference an <b>FDlist</b>, which is a separate list
of opcodes and operands that immediately follows the current FloorData
opcode.&nbsp; FDlist opcodes and operands are different from the base FloorData
opcodes and operands:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>FDfunction:&nbsp; </b>bits
10-13 (0x3C00)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Operands:&nbsp; </b>bits
0-9 (0x03FF) vary, depending on FDfunction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>FDcontinue:&nbsp; </b>bit
15 (0x8000)
<p>Several of the functions indicate adjustments to the sector's floor
and ceiling heights; these are specified by adjusting the corner heights.
The corners will be denoted as 00, 01, 10, and 11; the first is the corner's
X coordinate and the second is the corner's Z coordinate, with both given
as multiples of 1024.
<p><font color="#008000">When parsing functions for TR3, use only the lower
5 bits to find the function value, because some of TR3's functions use
the upper 3 bits of the lower byte as part of the operand. However, this
will also work correctly in TR1 and TR2.</font>
<p><b><u><font size=+1>FloorData Functions are described below.</font></u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x01: <b>Portal Sector</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x00: Room Portal:
the next FloorData element (the operand) is the number of the room that
this sector is a collisional portal to.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An entity that arrives in
a sector with this function present will gets its room membership changed
to this function's operand, without any change in position.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x02: <b>Floor Slant</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x00: Floor
Slant: The next FloorData element contains the slant values for the floor
of this sector.&nbsp; Slant values are specified in increments of 256 units.
The high byte (bit8) is the Z slope, while the low byte (bit8) is the X
slope. If the X slope is greater than zero, then its value is added to
the floor heights of corners 00 and 01. If it is less than zero, then its
value is subtracted from the floor heights of corners 10 and 11. If the
Z slope is greater than zero, then its value is added to the floor heights
of corners 00 and 10. If it is less than zero, then its value is subtracted
from the floor heights of corners 01 and 11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x03: <b>Ceiling Slant</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x00: Ceiling
Slant: The next FloorData element contains the slant values for the ceiling
of this sector.&nbsp; Slant values are specified in increments of 256 units.
The high byte (bit8) is the Z slope, while the low byte (bit8) is the X
slope. If the X slope is greater than zero, then its value is subtracted
from the ceiling heights of corners 10 and 11. If it is less than zero,
then its value is added to the ceiling heights of corners 00 and 01. If
the Z slope is greater than zero, then its value is subtracted from the
ceiling heights of corners 00 and 10. If it is less than zero, then its
value is added to the ceiling heights of corners 01 and 11.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x04: <b>Trigger</b> items, switch cameras,
end the level and much more.
<br>As used below, "run FDlist(activate or deactivate)" means go through
each element in FDlist and perform its function ("run FDlist+1" just means
start at FDlist[1] rather than FDlist[0]).&nbsp; Activate/deactivate is
only used for the activate/deactivate item function.
<br>There are two states for each item, active/inactive (the meaning depends
on the item, e.g. a tiger must be active to be seen, if a door is active
it is open, if it is inactive it is closed, etc.) and on/off (keyholes
and switches).
<br>The <b>bitu16</b> immediately following the 0x04 FloorData opcode contains
flags; the bits at 0x3e00 are the Activation Mask (which is XORed with
any appropriate item flags), the bit at 0x0100 indicates "state change
occurs only once". A good example of activation-mask use is the multiple-switch
room of "Palace Midas" in TR1.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x00: Run FDlist(activate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x01: If Lara
is on the ground, run FDlist(activate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x02: If item
at FDlist[0] is on, run FDlist+1(activate), else run FDlist+1(deactivate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x03: If item
at FDlist[0] is on, run FDlist+1(activate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x04: If item
at FDlist[0] is picked up, run FDlist+1(activate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x05: If item
at FDlist[0] is in this sector, run FDlist+1(activate), else run FDlist+1(deactivate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x06: If Lara
is on the ground, run FDlist(deactivate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x07: unknown
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x08: If Lara
is not on the ground, run FDlist(activate)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(mainly used for activating collision detection with such objects as footbridges)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SubFunction 0x09: Run FDlist(deactivate)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x05: <b>Kills Lara</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any SubFunction: If Lara
is on the ground, it kills Lara with fire.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function 0x06: <b>Climbable Walls</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This subfunction indicates
climbability of walls; its value is the bitwise OR of the values associated
with all the climbable-wall directions (0x01 ::= +Z, 0x02 ::= +X, 0x04
::= -Z, 0x08 ::= -X), e.g. SubFunction 0x09 indicates that the walls on
both the +Z and -X sides of this sector are climbable.
<p><font color="#008000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functions 0x07
to 0x12: (only in TR3) These specify the floor and ceiling slopes, which
are more complicated here, since these functions specify dividing up the
floors and ceilings into triangles along either of the two diagonals. Also,
one of the triangles may be a collisional portal to the room above (if
in the ceiling) or to the room below (if in the floor). The function word

<p><a NAME="MeshGeometry"></a><b><u><font size=+1>IV. Mesh Geometry</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>Overview: </b>Nearly all of the non-geographic visual elements in
TR2 (as well as a few parts of the landscape) are specified as <b>meshes</b>.&nbsp;
A <b>mesh</b> is simply a list of vertices and how they're arranged.&nbsp;
The TR2 mesh structure includes a list of vertices as relative coordinates
(which allows meshes to easily be placed anywhere in the world geometry),
a list of normals (to indicate which side of each face is visible), and
lists of Rectangles and Triangles, both Textured and Coloured.&nbsp; The
elements of each <a href="#struct.tr2_face4">tr2_face4</a> or <a href="#struct.tr2_face3">tr2_face3</a>
structure (Rectangles and Triangles) contain an offset into the Vertices[]
array for the mesh. Other arrays (Moveables[], StaticMeshes[]) do not reference
the array Meshes[] directly, but instead reference the array MeshPointers[],
which points to locations inside of Meshes[], inside of which the meshes
are stored in packed fashion.
<p><b>Meshes:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign of the number of normals specifies
which sort of lighting to use. If the sign is positive, then external vertex
lighting is used, with the lighting calculated from the room's ambient

<p><a NAME="MeshConstructionAndAnimation"></a><b><u><font size=+1>V. Mesh
Construction and Animation</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>Overview:</b>
<br>The animated mesh objects in the Tomb Raider series are sets of meshes
that are moved relative to each other, as defined by Moveables[] entries.
Each entry describes which meshes to be used (a contiguous set of them
referred to in MeshPointers[]), what hierarchy and relative offsets they
have (contents of MeshTree[] pointed to), and what animations are to be
used (contents of Animations[] pointed to).
<p>The hierarchy used is a branching one, with the meshes being at the
nodes, and with the first mesh being the root node. The MeshTree[] values,
called "Bone2" in some documentation, are applied to each of the child
meshes in sequence; they are sets of four <a href="#Data.Types">bit32</a>'s, the first being a hierarchy
operator, and the remaining three being the coordinates in the parent mesh's
system. A hierarchy example is that for the Lara meshes:
<pre>Hips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left thigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left shin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right thigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right shin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left inner arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left outer arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right inner arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right outer arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head
(Ponytail is a separate object)</pre>
This is implemented by using a stack of meshes and "push" and "pop" operations
in MeshTree[]. Normally, each mesh's parent is the previous mesh in series.
But such meshes can be "remembered" by adding them to a stack of meshes
with a "push" operation. This remembered mesh can then be used as the parent
mesh with a "pop" operation. It is not clear what the maximum stack depth
is; most TR mesh stacks do not extend beyond 2 or 3 meshes.
<p>The animations for each mesh object are selected with some ingenious
techniques. Which animations to use are not hardcoded; instead, each entity
has some states it can be in, and these states are used to select which
animation. For example, locks have only one state (they just sit there),
doors have two states (open and closed), and Lara has numerous states,
such as standing, walking, running, jumping, falling, being hurt, dying,
etc. Each animation has a state ID, which can be used to select it; however,
state transitions might seem to require a large number of intermediate
states (opening, closing, starting to jump, landing, etc.). The alternative
used in the Tomb Raider engine is for each animation to have bridge animations
to other states' animations, which are selected using the ID of which state
to change to. These bridge animations then lead to the animation with the
appropriate state. Thus, a closed door will run a looped closed-door animation
as long as its state stays "closed", but when its state becomes "open",
it will change to an opening-door bridge animation, which will end in a
looped open-door animation. Likewise, closing a door will make it use a
closing-door bridge animation. Some bridge animations are chosen with a
finer grain of selectivity, however, such as using one for left foot forward
and one for right foot forward.
<p>Thus, each animation references a set of StateChange structures (called
simply a "structure" in some documentation), each one of which references
an AnimDispatch structure (called a "range" in some documentation). Each
StateChange structure contains a new state and which AnimDispatch structures
to use. When an entity goes into a new state, the StateChange structures
are scanned for that state's ID, and if one matches, then that StateChange's
AnimDispatches are then scanned for a range of frames that contains the
ID of the current frame. If such an AnimDispatch is found, the animation
and the frame are changed to those listed in it.
<p>The ultimate unit of animation is, of course, the frame, and each frame
consists of a bounding box, the offset of the root mesh, and rotation angles
for all the meshes with respect to their parent meshes. The root mesh is
also rotated, but relative to the object's overall coordinates. All rotations
are performed around the meshes' origins, and are in order Y, X, Z (yaw,
pitch, roll). The reason for the root mesh's displacement is because entities
traveling on solid surfaces are likely tracked by having their locations
be at ground level, and Lara's hips, for example, are well above the ground.
Finally, some of the angles are not specified explicitly, when they are
not, they are zero.
<p>Frames are referenced in two ways, either by an offset into the Frames[]
array that contains them, or by frame index. The values of the latter appear
to be unique to each kind of entity, but not between entities; the first
frame for each kind is numbered 0. This is likely a convenience when constructing
the animations, since the list of animation frames for each entity can
be constructed separately. However, using these indices is fairly simple.
Each Animation structure has a first-frame index; this index is subtracted
from the index of the desired frame in order to find out its index relative
to the animation's first frame.
<p>There are also some special AnimCommands (called "Bone1" in some documentation)
for doing various additional things. Some of them are for setting reference
points; these may either be 3D ones, for example for grab locations, or
2D ones, for jumps from surface. Some others define actions per frame,
like playing sounds, emitting bubbles, and so forth.
<p>Finally, some entities appear to have very incomplete animations; their
complete animations are "borrowed" from similar entities. One example of
this is the various goons in TR2's Venice levels -- some of them have a
full set of animations, while some others have only the standing animation.
The ones with only the standing animation borrow their other animations
from the fully-animated ones.

<br>&nbsp;* When both are present, the bit-0 operation is always done before the
bit-1 operation; in effect, read the stack but do not change it.

<p><a NAME="NonPlayerCharacterBehaviour"></a><b><u><font size=+1>VI. Non-Player
Character Behaviour</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>Overview:</b>
<br>All the Tomb Raider game physics and entity behavior appears to be
hardcoded, with each type ID being associated with some specific sort of
behavior (as Lara, as a boat, as a tiger, as a door, as a boulder, as a
lock, etc.). There is no sign of the sorts of schemes used by some other
game engines for specifying this behavior in data files. One scheme is
to use generic characters, generic projectiles, and so forth, and to specialize
them by reading in appropriate records from data files. Another scheme is to use interpreted pseudocode; this
is used by id's Quake. This hardcoding makes it difficult to port the earlier
Tomb Raider scenarios to the engines of the later games, which could be
desirable with their improved 3D-card and sound-card support. While textures,
models, and animations can be ported, behavior cannot be.
<p>However, there is a hint that TR3 may have some such information. Some
of its characters are hostile in some levels, and not in others (the India-level
monkeys, the Antarctica-level flamethrower wielders); there may be some
flag in Items[] that determines whether a character is hostile or not.
But the hostile and non-hostile versions of these characters may have separate
type ID's.
<p>Despite that lack, the Tomb Raider series does have navigation hints
for the Non-Player Characters; those entities that move freely across the
maps under the command of the game AI. One of the NPC's is the camera,
since only Lara (and the vehicles she rides) is under the direct control
of the player; the game AI makes the camera follow Lara. The camera uses
the navigation hints used by the flying NPC's; these can be constructed
so as to help the camera out of tight spots.
<p>The navigation hints are three data structures: boxes, overlaps, and
zones. Most sectors point to some box, the main exceptions being horizontal-portal
sectors. Several neighbring sectors may point to the same box. A box is
a horizontal rectangle, with corners and height specified; each box also
has a pointer into the list of overlaps. Each segment in that list is the
list of accessible neighboring boxes for some box; the NPC's apparently
select from this list to decide where to go next. This selection is done
with the help of the zones. These structures of <font color="#FF0000">6 (TR1)</font>
or 10 (TR2, TR3)
<a href="#Data.Types">bit16</a>'s that act as zone ID's; their overall indexing is the same as the
boxes, meaning that each box will have an associated set of zone ID's.
An NPC will select one of this set to use, and will prefer to go into the
overlaps-list boxes that have the same zone value as the box it is currently
in. For example, one can create guard paths by making chains of zone-ID-sharing
boxes, with their overlaps pointing to the next boxes in those chains.

<p><b>Overlaps:</b>
<p>This is a set of lists of neighboring boxes for each box, each member
being a bitu16; the highest bit being set marks the end of each list. NPC's
apparently use this list to decide where to go next.
<p><b>Zones:</b>
<p>This is a set of bit16's, <font color="#FF0000">6 for TR1</font> and
10 for TR2 and TR3. NPCs prefer to travel to a box with the same zone ID
as the one they are currently at. Which of these zone ID's it uses depends
on the kind of the NPC and its current state. The first half of the Zones
structure is for the "normal" room state, and the second half is for the
"alternate" room state. TR1, for example, has 2 sets of ground zones and
1 set of fly zones; its zones are
<p>ground zone 1 (normal)
<br>ground zone 2 (normal)
<br>fly zone (normal)
<br>ground zone 1 (alternate)
<br>ground zone 2 (alternate)
<br>fly zone (alternate)
<p>The ground zones are for NPC's that travel on the ground, while the
fly zones are for flying or swimming NPC's. TR2 and TR3 have similar breakdowns,
though they have 4 ground zones.

<p><a NAME="Sound"></a><b><u><font size=+1>VII. Sound</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>Overview:</b>
<br>The Tomb Raider series makes abundant use of sound, which appears in
a variety of contexts. Sounds can be either continuous or triggered. Continuous
ones can be for the whole level or produced by some sound-source object.
The whole-level sound is a CD-track sound, which is played continuously,
thus the blowing-wind sounds in the underground parts of "The Great Wall".
Sound-source objects make sound in a range around some specific point.
Likewise, triggered ones can be triggered by a variety of events. The triggering
can be hardcoded in the engine (gunshots, switch pulls) or by reaching
some animation frame (footsteps, Lara's somewhat unladylike sounds). Switch
pulls and/or door sounds may be specified with operand of FDFunction 0x09;
operand values lower than those used for assault-course clock control may
specify which sounds to use.
<p>Though CD-track sounds are referred to by track index, game-data sounds
are referred to by an internal sound index; this is translated into which
sound sample with the help of three layers of indexing, to allow for a
suitable degree of abstraction. Internal sound indices for various sounds
appear to be consistent across all the level files in a game; a gunshot
or a passport opening in one level file will have the same internal sound
index as in all the others. The highest level of these is the SoundMap[]
array, which translates the internal sound index into an index into SoundDetails[].
Each SoundDetails record contains such details as the sound intensity,
how many samples to select from, and an index into SampleIndices[]. This
allows for selecting among multiple samples to produce variety; that index
is the index to the SampleIndices[] value of first of these, with the rest
of them being having the next indices in series of that array. Thus, if
the number of samples is 4, then the TR engine looks in SampleIndices[]
locations Index, Index+1, Index+2, and Index+3. Finally, the SampleIndices[]
array references some arrays of sound samples. In TR1, these samples are
embedded in the level files, and SampleIndices[] contains the displacements
of each one in bytes from the beginning of that embedded block. In TR2
and TR3, these samples are concatenated in the file "MAIN.SFX" with no
additional information; SampleIndices[] contains sequence numbers (0, 1,
2, 3, ...) in MAIN.SFX. Finally , the samples themselves are all in Microsoft
WAVE format.
<p>The CD-audio tracks are stored in different fashions in the various
versions of the TR series. <font color="#008000">In the PC version of TR3, they are all stored
in the file CDAUDIO.WAD, which has the format (source: Sven, BachmannS@gmx.net,
http://wotsit.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi?tr3audio): a series of header records
with this format:
<pre>{ // 0x108 bytes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit32 SampleLength;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // how many bytes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit32 SampleOffset;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // offset in file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit8 Name[256];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // C string; the length is a guess, because Sven's sizes are inconsistent.
};</pre>
followed by embedded samples in the Microsoft WAVE format.</font>
<p>In the Macintosh versions of TR1 and TR2, the CD audio tracks are separate
files in AIFF format, while in the Macintosh version of TR3, these tracks
are separate files in Microsoft WAVE format. The Macintosh version of TR3
contains an additional file, CDAudio.db, which contains the names of all
the track files as 32-byte zero-padded C strings with no extra contents.

<br>A 32*256 array of <a href="#Data.Types">bitu8</a>'s which is apparently for applying light to
8-bit colour, in some documentation called "ColourMap". The current palette
index and lighting value are used to calcuate an index to this table, which
is a table of palette indices.
<p>The Tomb Raider series' software rendering, like that of most real-time-3D
games, uses 8-bit colour for speed and low bulk; however, there is the
serious problem of how to do lighting with 8-bit colour, because doing
it directly is computationally expensive. The usual solution is to arrange
the palettes' colours in ramps, which the engine then follows in the appropriate
directions. However, the TR series' palettes generally lack such neat ramps.
<p>But the TR series has a more general solution, one that does not require
palettes to have colour ramps. It uses precalculated lighting tables, the
"ColourMap" objects. These contain translations of a colour value and a
lighting value, listed by palette index. The translation goes as follows:
<p>n = ColourMap[256 * k + i];
<p>where i is the original palette index, k is determined from the lighting
value, and n is the new palette index. The lighting index k varies from
0 to 31, and the corresponding lighting value is, <font color="#FF0000">for TR1,
<p>2 - k / 16</font>
<p>and for TR2 and TR3,
<p>2 - (k + 1) / 16
<p>This may be associated with the curious fact of the lighting values
in the data files increasing in the "wrong" direction in TR1 and TR2, with
0 being full brightness and greater values being darker.

<p>TR1 has no colour table or 16-bit palette before the start of the textures;
it also lacks 16-bit textures.
<p>In TR1, tr2_vertex_room_struct has after its tr2_vertex struct only
the first light intensity, and not the attributes or the second intensity.
<p>In TR1, after SectorData, there is only the first light intensity, and
not the second one or the lighting mode.
<p>In TR1, tr2_room_light_struct has only one of:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitu16 Diffuse1/2
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitu32 Unknown1/2
<p>In TR1, tr2_room_static does not have two light intensities, but only
one.
<p>"Boxes" objects are rectangles whose four horizontal-coordinate values
are bitu8's in TR2 and bit32's in TR1.
<p>"Zones" objects have 10 bit16's in TR2, but 6 bit16's in TR1
<p>In TR1, tr2_item_struct is like the TR2 version, but with only one light
intensity.
<p>The TR1 colour table has the same format as the TR2 colour table, but
it is located between the LightMap and the cinematic frames.
<p>SoundMap is 370 bit16's in TR2, but 256 bit16's in TR1.
<p>Between SoundDetails and SampleIndices, TR1 has all the level's sound
samples, in the form of embedded Microsoft WAVE files. Just before these
samples is the total number of bytes in those sound samples, which is a
bit32.

<p>After the two room-light intensities, TR2 has a lighting-mode value,
which TR3 lacks.
<p>Also in tr2_room_struct, TR3 has 3 extra bytes at the end, which appears
to be the room-light color.
<p>Finally, in TR2, the tr2_object_texture data is before the tr2_sprite_texture
data. In TR3, it is before the tr2_item data.

<p>Presumably as a form of copy protection, the demo versions of some of
the TR games use levels that are slightly different from those in the retail
versions. However, those that have been found are all data rearrangements,
as explained below.
<p>The TR1 and Unfinished Business (.TUB) demos have their palettes moved
to between the SpriteSequences and the Cameras.
<p>The TR2 "Wall" demo, and maybe also its "Venice" demo, has its LightMap
(8K) moved to between the SpriteSequences and the Cameras. It also has
its SampleIndices content replaced by the soundfiles, though the associated
number of them remains unchanged (the number of indices becomes the number
of samples).
<p>That demo also has its own version of TOMBPC.DAT, called DEMOPC.DAT,
which appears to have the exact same format as TOMBPC.DAT.
<p>No rearrangements are known for the TR3 demos.

<p><b>Overview: </b>The flow of the game, which levels come in what order,
what item(s) Lara has at the beginning of each level, the filenames of
the level and cut-scene files, all the visible text (e.g. "Save Game,"
"Rusty Key," etc.), and various other options are controlled using a file
called TOMBPC.DAT. This file is normally compiled using a utility called
GAMEFLOW.EXE, which was (apparently) accidentally distributed by Eidos
in the German distribution of Tomb Raider II Gold. TR2 and TR3 use this
file, and use essentially the same format of it, but TR1 has this file's
contents embedded in the app, which explains why there are separate TR1
and Unfinished Business apps. What follows is a description of the contents
of the binary TOMBPC.DAT file.

found that the two lion types are the two sexes of lions and that the crocodiles

Also, Lara's evil-twin mutant has only the breathing animation; its mirror-image

object in the center of the room that this mutant lives in; there has to
be some such point to refer the reflection to.
<p>This contains the states of everything but Lara.
